How do I get user consent and what would that look like?


ChatGPT said:
Getting user consent for accessing their Google account (including Drive and Docs) is built into OAuth 2.0. Google handles the consent screen for you ‚Äî you just configure it in the Google Cloud Console, and your app redirects users to it when they click ‚ÄúSign in with Google.‚Äù

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: How to Get User Consent
1. Set up a Google Cloud Project
Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com

Create a project (or use an existing one)

2. Enable APIs
From the left menu:

Go to APIs & Services ‚Üí Library

Enable:

Google Drive API

Google Docs API

(Also optional: Google People API, if you want profile info)

3. Configure OAuth consent screen
Go to:
üìç APIs & Services ‚Üí OAuth consent screen

User Type: Choose External (for non-Google Workspace users)

App Info:

App name

Logo (optional)

Developer email

Scopes: Add the scopes your app needs:

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file (create files in user's Drive)

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents (create/edit Google Docs)

Note: Drive access is limited by the scope ‚Äî use drive.file if you want access only to files your app creates.

Test Users: Add your personal Gmail (and any test emails) if you haven‚Äôt published the app yet

4. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
üìç Go to APIs & Services ‚Üí Credentials

Click ‚ÄúCreate Credentials‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúOAuth client ID‚Äù

Choose Web Application

Add Authorized redirect URIs, like:

http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback (for local dev)

https://yourdomain.com/auth/google/callback (for production)

You'll get:

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

5. Add the sign-in route in your app
Your Svelte/Express app would redirect the user to the Google consent screen:

js
Copy
Edit
app.get('/auth/google', passport.authenticate('google', {
  scope: [
    'profile',
    'email',
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file',
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents'
  ]
}));
When they click this link or button, they are taken to a screen like this:

üñºÔ∏è Example: Google Consent Screen
The user sees something like:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
[Your App Name] wants to access your Google Account
- See your personal info (name, email)
- Create and access Google Docs on your behalf
- Manage your Google Drive files that you create with this app

[Allow]   [Cancel]
6. Get the user's token after consent
Your callback handles this:

js
Copy
Edit
app.get('/auth/google/callback', passport.authenticate('google', {
  failureRedirect: '/login',
  session: true
}), (req, res) => {
  // ‚úÖ User is signed in and accessToken is stored in req.user
  res.redirect('/dashboard'); // or wherever you want to send them
});
üîê Once they allow access‚Ä¶
You now have:

The user's Google profile

An accessToken that lets your app:

Create Google Docs

Save them in their Google Drive

I can show you a simple Express + Passport setup with Google Drive/Docs integration that lets each user:

Sign in with Google

Generate a document

Save it to their Google Drive

I don't understand where is this to be displayed to the user. So, first of all, how do I get their Google information? And then after I get their information, how am I going to display them? I'm asking permission, or where will the user see this?


ChatGPT said:
Great questions ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk through exactly how the user experiences this, and how you, as the developer, set it up and handle their info.

üß≠ Overview
Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre trying to do:

‚úÖ Let the user sign in with Google (no form, no password ‚Äî just Google).

‚úÖ Ask for permission to access their Drive and Docs.

‚úÖ Use their identity and access token to create and save files in their Google Drive.

So:

üîπ The Google Sign-In flow gives you:

Their name/email

A Google-hosted permission screen

An access token to make API calls on their behalf

üß™ What the User Sees
1. Your App Has a ‚ÄúSign in with Google‚Äù Button
This could be a simple button on your login page:

html
Copy
Edit
<a href="/auth/google">
  <button>Sign in with Google</button>
</a>
2. When They Click, They Are Redirected to Google‚Äôs Consent Screen
Google takes them to a screen like:

less
Copy
Edit
[Your App Name] wants to access your Google Account:

‚úÖ View your basic profile info  
‚úÖ Create and manage Google Docs  
‚úÖ View and manage your Google Drive files

[Allow]   [Deny]
This screen is automatically created and displayed by Google ‚Äî you don‚Äôt build this UI yourself.

3. If They Click ‚ÄúAllow,‚Äù Google Redirects Them Back to Your Site
You set this up via:

js
Copy
Edit
passport.use(new GoogleStrategy({
  clientID: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
  callbackURL: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback'
}, function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
  // profile = user's Google info
  // accessToken = lets you access Google APIs (Drive, Docs)
  return done(null, { profile, accessToken });
}));
Google redirects to your callback URL with the user's info, and your app saves it in the session or database.

üõ†Ô∏è What You Do With It
After the user consents, your Express app receives:

profile: their Google name, email, ID, photo

accessToken: a secure token that lets you create/edit Google Docs for them

Now you can:

Show a welcome page: "Welcome, Sarah!"

Let them fill out your form

Then create a Google Doc with their form data, and save it in their Drive using that token

‚úÖ To Recap
Step	User Sees / Does	What You Set Up
1	Click ‚ÄúSign in with Google‚Äù	A button with a link to /auth/google
2	Sees Google consent screen	Configured via Google Cloud
3	Clicks ‚ÄúAllow‚Äù	Google redirects to your /auth/google/callback route
4	Sees your app's page (dashboard, form)	You use req.user.profile and req.user.accessToken
5	Form is filled ‚Üí saved to Google Drive	Use Google Docs + Drive APIs with their token
